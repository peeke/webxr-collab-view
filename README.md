# webxr-collab-view
Multiple viewing clients onto the same XR scene

## What is this?
This is just a simple, hacked together POC. The goal is to have multiple clients look at a scene through their device camera, displaying an AR model which is consistent for the clients.

## Progress 
- A basic Web XR demo is implemented
- Recognize a perspective transform between two images of the same scene
